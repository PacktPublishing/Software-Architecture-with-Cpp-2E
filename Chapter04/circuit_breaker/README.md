### Technical requirements

You'll need Docker to run the examples from this chapter.

For the tracing and reverse proxy, and the canary releases example you'll
also need Docker Compose.

### Running the examples

To run the examples:

```bash
./build.sh
./run.sh
```

To stop the examples:

```bash
./stop.sh
```

### Envoy

Make requests to the Envoy proxy by calling http://localhost:10000.
